- Hi, I’m Flavio Breazzano.
- I’m currently studying an Advanced Diploma in Applied Science (Robotics and Artificial Intelligence), with ACS Distance Education, United Kingdom.
- I have had experience with HTML, JavaScript, SQL for the Web, Visual Basic.NET, and ASP.NET.
- I’m currently working on C# programming assignments for my studies.
- In the near future I will be learning how to program quantum artificial intelligence, on a quantum computing architectural substrate, connected to digital systems.
- Following the advanced diploma I will be studying a Bachelor of Science, and a Master of Science in Computer Science (Computation Engineering), and have even been offered a PhD scholarship from Professor Uwe Aickelin, at the University of Melbourne, Australia, that will be focused on quantum neuro-interfaced robotics and artificial intelligence engineering, as long as I maintain a high grade average throughout the rest of my studies.
- I also recently participated in a virtual internship with the Carboncopies Foundation in the US, as part of their scientific ethics team, directed by Dr. Randal Koene, that conducts research into mind uploading technologies, on the quest to immortality.
- In addition, I am also a member of DARPAConnect and the US DOD's SciTechCONNECT, as well as a potential innovator and researcher with the US Pentagon's DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency).
- Over the next few months I will be submitting a research grant proposal to DARPA in regard to a quantum mind uploading project that I intend to instantiate in collaboration with the Carboncopies Foundation, and have already obtained positive feedback from senior DARPA members, and experienced scientists, in regard to what I intend to accomplish.
- Please feel free to visit my LinkedIn profile for more details of my studies, research, and work.
